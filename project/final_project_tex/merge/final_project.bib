  abstract =      {The properties of the oxygen isotopes provide diverse
                   examples of progress made in experiments and theory.
                   This chain of isotopes has been studied from beyond
                   the proton drip line in 12O to beyond the neutron
                   drip line in 25,26O. This short survey starts with
                   the microscopic G matrix approach for 18O of Kuo and
                   Brown in the 1960's and shows how theory has evolved.
                   The nuclear structure around the doubly-magic nucleus
                   24O is particularly simple in terms of the nuclear
                   shell model. The nuclear structure around the
                   doubly-magic nucleus 16O exhibits the coexistence of
                   single-particle and collective structure.},

  abstract =      {The intention of this work is to investigate the
                   applicability of the free nucleon-nucleon potential
                   determined by the scattering data in the shell-model
                   description of finite nuclei. The potential is chosen
                   to be that of Hamada and Johnston. We have chosen 18O
                   and 18F as our first numerical calculations. A major
                   part of the work reported here concerns the
                   evaluation of the shell-model reaction matrix
                   elements. They are evaluated using the separation
                   method for the singlet-even and triplet-even states
                   and the reference spectrum method for the singlet-odd
                   and triplet-odd states. The second-order Born term
                   for the triplet-even tensor force is found to be very
                   important. It can be calculated conveniently and with
                   good accuracy using the closure approximation with an
                   energy denomiator of ≈ 220 MeV. Assuming the
                   singlet-particle wave functions to be those of a
                   harmonic oscillator well, the single-particle energy
                   levels of 0d52, 1s12 and 0d32 for 170 are calculated
                   by letting the valence nucleon interact with 16O
                   core. The results are very encouraring. The 0d52
                   −0d32 splitting is found to come mostly from the
                   triplet-odd 1 {\textperiodcentered} s force through
                   the reaction matrix Hartree-Fock process. The spectra
                   of 18O and 18F are satisfactorily reproduced by
                   diagonalizing the model interaction G$\Theta$3p1h in
                   the sd shell, except for the states which are
                   presumed to be largely deformed; G is the reaction
                   matrix and $\Omega$3p1h is the wave operator which
                   takes care of the corrections arising from the
                   one-particle-one-hole excitation of the 16O core. It
                   is found that the conventional shell-model effective
                   interactions are well reproduced by the model
                   interaction deduced from the free nucleon-nucleon
                   potential.},
