To verify that the code descirbed in the previous section works, several isotopes of oxygen were computed with LNLT\_shell and compared to the result from NuShellX with the USDB interaction. In table \ref{tab:ox18},\ref{tab:ox19} and \ref{tab:ox20} the eigenenergies of \(^{18,19,20}\rm{O}\) are compared to the values computed with NuShellX. The energies are relative the ground energy of \(^{16}\rm{O}\). There are almost no difference to the given numerical precission, only a few of the higher eigen-values differ slightly. In addition the code seems to correctly assign total angular momentum; the \(J_L\) columns are identical with the \(J_N\) columns. To illustrate the similarity further, the lowest energies are ploted in figure \ref{fig:ox18eig},\ref{fig:ox19eig} and \ref{fig:ox20eig}, where also a comparision to experiment is made.

In addition to the eigen-spectrum for each shell-occupation numbers where also computed. In Table \ref{tab:ox18occ} all the shell-occupation numbers for all \(14\) states can be viewed, computed both with LNLT\_shell and with NuShellX. There are some slight difference, however this can be easily explained with that LNLT\_shell outputs higher precision than NuShellX does and thus the difference is moste likely due to rounding errors. In Figs. \ref{fig:occnum_lnlt} and \ref{fig:occnum_nushellx} the shell occupation for the ground state and the first excited states are visualized, computed by LNLT\_shell and NuShellX respectively. Also here there are a slight difference, which still can be explained with rounding errors. \\
