We examine the structure of $ ^{18-28} $O isotopes by employing our own shell-model program and by using the NushellX@MSU program. The former program is developed using the $ M $-scheme and is intended mainly for the $ sd $-shell, where an $ ^{16} $O core is assumed. Using our code we calculate energy spectra and occupation numbers and compare them with NushellX@MSU. Using NushellX@MSU we examine further observables such as (\textit{i}) the $ \beta $-decay of $ ^{22} $O to $ ^{22} $F, looking at the Fermi sum rule, $ q $-value and half-life of the decay, and (\textit{ii}) $ E2 $ transitions between the first $ 2^+ $ and the ground state using different interactions, for the even-even oxygen isotopes.
