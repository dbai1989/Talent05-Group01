\section{NushellX}
The structure of the wave functions of different levels in the oxygen isotopes is interesting to examine since it can reveal the role of different configurations and orbits. Furthermore, within a given configuration examining different interactions using different observables can be also insightful. 
In the first subsection we examine using NushellX@MSU the spectra of oxygen isotopes and the capability of different interactions, the USDA, USDB and coupled cluster effective interaction (CCEI) \cite{Jansen2016} to reproduce spectra. The second subsection is devoted to the study of Fermi and Gamow-Teller $\beta$-decay of $^{22}$O and how the USDB and CCEI interactions fulfill sum rules. The third subsection addresses electromagnetic transitions rates for different isotopes and interactions.
