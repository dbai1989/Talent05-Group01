Where is my name in the Authors? :-P
Attach also python program?

noam-intro.tex
	line 36 when and other quantum numbers -> what you wanted to say?
	line 38 The SPE values and order is given -> are given

tor-code_explaination.tex
	line  7 A nuclear shell-model code approximate -> approximates
	line 59 where the single-particle basis, the many-body basis and the eigen-spectrum of the Hamiltonian. -> something missing? verb?

tor-compare_to_nushellx.tex
	line  6 descirbed -> described 
	line  6 reference missing in pdf
	line  6 the eigenenergies of \(^{18,19,20}\rm{O}\) is compared -> are compared
	line  6 the lowest energies are ploted -> plotted
	line 33 In addition to the eigen-spectrum for each shell-occupation numbers where also computed -> each .. isotope? + where -> were
	line 33 There are some slight difference -> differences
	line 33 is moste likely -> is most
	line 33 Also here there are a slight difference -> is

noam-nushellx-intro.tex
	line  3 The third subsection address -> addresses

luca-nushellx.tex
	line 08 add in caption: Experimental errorbars are really small compared to plot resolution.
	line 13 $^{26}$ oxygen -> $^{26}$ O ?
	line 14 add in the end: This may be due to the presence of Coulomb forces CCEI interaction and are therefore iso-spin breaking and it behaves differently with increasing neutron number in isotope chains.
	line 16 black dots in the experimental panel indicates -> indicate
	line 30 add in the end: This different level ordering may also be related to the inclusion of Coulomb forces in CCEI interaction, which may exchange energy-levels.
	line 36 add in the end: (USDA interaction gives similar results of USDB interaction).

	Tor comment: Do we have any idea why ccei underestimates the half-life time (perhaps it hopes for an early release of Half-Life 3?) and why usdb overestimates the q-value?
	Luca comment: I have no clue.
