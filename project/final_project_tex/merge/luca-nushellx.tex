\subsection{Oxygen isotopes spectra with different interactions} \label{Oxygen}
%
We analyze how the different interactions reproduce the excitation energy of the first $2^+$ state in even-even oxygen isotopes from $^{18}$O to $^{26}$O and compare to experiment. This is seen in Fig. \ref{fig:2+/0+}   and gives an indication on the location of the shell closure. The latter  arises when the excitation energy from the g.s. to the first excited $2^+$ state is at maximum.

The USDA and USDB interactions give similar results,  are in good agreement with experimental results and give a good description of the shell closure at $^{24}$O. Since USDB has more linear combination of parameters than USDA it generates a better agreement with the experimental results. 
The CCEI interaction underestimates the excitation energies up to $^{26}$O, while at shell closure it emphasize this effect by overestimating the first $2^+$ state energy. 
It is interesting to note that CCEI interactions seems to give a good description in rich neutron isotopes, close to the neutron drip line. This may be due to the presence of Coulomb forces CCEI interaction and are therefore iso-spin breaking and it behaves differently with increasing neutron number in isotope chains.

We next explore the spectra of even-odd oxygen isotopes. Among them we analyze the spectrum of $^{19}$O since it has the largest amount of experimental data. The results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:19O}. Note that the experimental results show also negative parity states (blue lines), which are not included in our theoretical calculations since we are working in the $sd$ model space. For completeness black dots in the experimental panel indicate states which have not been assigned to a definite parity.

The USDA and USDB reproduce the correct spin orderings, where the USDA yields better results up to the first $1/2^+$ at energy 1.422 MeV and the USDB yields better results from the first $9/2^+$ at energy 2.370 MeV up to the second $3/2^+$ at energy 3.802 MeV. The differences are not significant though and further tests for comparison could be electromagnetic transition rates.
The CCEI exchanges the order of the first $3/2^+$ with the g.s. and the order of the first $9/2^+$ and the first $1/2^+$, causing both pairs to be nearly degenerate. The former case is reasonable since the g.s. and the first $3/2^+$ are nearly degenerate,  however the latter case exhibits a larger discrepancy from experiment. This different level ordering may also be related to the inclusion of Coulomb forces in CCEI interaction, which may exchange energy-levels.

\subsection{Fermi and Gamow-Teller $\beta$-decay of $^{22}$O}
%
On top of energies, it is insightful to examine other observables in order to understand better the differences between different interactions. We analyze the $\beta$-decay of $^{22}$O to $^{22}$F.
We perform the calculations using NushellX for the USDB and CCEI interactions (USDA interaction gives similar results of USDB interaction).

\end{table}

Both interactions fulfill the theoretical Fermi sum rule, but in different ways.
The contribution of the CCEI interaction to the Fermi sum rule b(f) splits among different states: this is because the e interaction has several nearly degenerate levels which mix. The USDB interaction gives all the contribution to b(f) in one single state, which is the isobar analogue of the $^{22}$O.

Let us compare the results obtained with the two different interactions to the experimental results for the q-value and the half-life. Note that one has to include more than only the default ten levels for each spin state in NushellX in order to get significant results, otherwise too much information is neglected.
\begin{table}[h!]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The CCEI interaction gives a good description of the q-value, but underestimates the half-life, while the USDB interaction is in good agreement with the experimental value for the half-life, but slightly overestimates the q-value.
