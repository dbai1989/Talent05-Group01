We succesfully develop a simple shell-model code, which is able to reproduce the results obtained with the already enstablished NushellX code,  with the same interaction(USDB), but working in $M$-scheme.
The code we develop is able to describe all oxygen isotopes within the $sd$-model space and to give prediction on their spectra. Moreovere we were able to implement the computation of operators such as occupation number and $J^2$ in our code.
It is important to remark that the performace of our code is worse than the professional code NushellX, but the main aim was to be able to self-develop a simple shell-model code.

On the other side we examine using NushellX the spectra of oxygen isotopes, looking at the effect of different interactions (USDA, USDB and CCEI).
We explored and analysed not only spectra of oxygen isotopes, but we look also at the effect of different interaction in the study of Fermi and Gamow-Teller $\beta$-decay of $^{22}$O and electromagnetic transitions rates in different oxygen isotopes.
While USDB and USDA interactions give really similar results with respect to all the observables we studied, the CCEI interaction shows interesting deviations from USD-type interactions behavior.
This is mainly due to the presence of the Coulomb interaction, which breaks isopin, and mixes up states differently from USD-type interactions.
