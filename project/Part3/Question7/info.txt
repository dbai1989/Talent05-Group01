# o23_o22.ans is already complete of all 3 steps we need:
# (1) lpe of 23O
# (2) lpe of 22O
# (3) dens computes spectroscopic factors from GS of 23O to all 22O states

shell o23_o22.ans
# the two folders have more ore less the same input
# standard: up to 10 levels in excitated states
# more levels: up to 50 levels in excitated states
# care! It computes ONLY bound states

chmod +x o23_o22.bat

# look in *.occ to get the occupation orbitals (o_23b.occ)
# 0d3    0d5    1s1
# 0.17   5.81   1.02
# compare with sum rule in spectroscopic factors in *.lsf according to 
# equation 40.13 (Alex notes)
# if I sum all I get the total occupation number of neutrons (7)
# I can look at different orbitals looking at (n,l,2j) and summing them up!
# BUG: total sum is total sum displayed + sum of last term
