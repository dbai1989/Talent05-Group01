#in this bat file we run 'map' which takes as input the output of 'dens', i.e. *.den,
#and gives the output *.deo (more interesting) and *.dei
#If you need to tweak edit *.den and re-run ./o22g.bat


#To compare B(E2) we need to convert from e^2*fm^4 to e^2*b^2 in terms of Weisskopf Units
#for B(E2) 1 W.U = 5.940*10^(-6)*A^(4/3) [e^2*b^2]

#We get in terms of W.U. 1.08 (with NushellX) for 1st exitated 2+ state to GS (gamma decay) compare to 1.2 (5) from ensdf
