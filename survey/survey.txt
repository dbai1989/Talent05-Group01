1) What where your expectations and were they met?


2) Was the course useful?


3) What is your overall experience?


4) Daily workload
The workload was as much as it should be when considering working in groups. However there was not enough time to solve all excercises and computational project individually. Therefore it turns out that some students worked more on NushellX and some on the computational project. Although this is natuarlly inevitable personaly I would prefer working on everything to learn all the topics. I would have also liked to have more time to read the suggested articles in the course. Although perhaps this should be done after finishing the course.

5) Interactions with instructors
The interactions were very good. All intructors were inviting to ask questions and always seemed to be avialable. They also answered all my questions in a satisfactory manner.

6) Content of lectures
The content was very interesting. I would be happy if we could also learn some more on double-beta decay, however there is a limit to how much one can learn in a single intensive course as this one.

7) Pedagogical quality of lectures
I would prefer using the black board in Alex Brown's lectures. While this method usually consumes more time, it can be more rigorous and further details can be discussed. The content of the book is very interesting, the chosen topics are very important and well explained. I believe it could be used as an excellent supplamentary for his lectures.

8) Interest and relevance of exercises
Everything was relevant and interesting.
