1) What where your expectations and were they met?


2) Was the course useful?
Noam: the course was very useful. I learned a lot. Before taking the course I knew the shell-model in a superficial manner. Now its seems I know much more.

3) What is your overall experience?
Noam: amazing. The atmosphere was great and exactly as it should in such an intensive course.

4) Daily workload
Noam: the workload was a much as it should be. Of course one can always choose to work more or less compared to others and even if one project is finished you can always choose to expand it. 


5) Interactions with instructors
Noam: the interactions were very good. All intructors were inviting to ask questions and always seemed to be avialable. They also answered all my questions in a satisfactory manner.

6) Content of lectures
Noam: the content was very interesting. I would be happy if we could also learn some more on double-beta decay, however there is a limit to how much one can learn in a single intensive course as this one.

7) Pedagogical quality of lectures
Noam: I would prefer using the black board in Alex Brown's lectures. While this method usually consumes more time, it can be more rigorous and further details can be discussed. The content of the book is very interesting, the chosen topics are very important and well explained. I believe it could be used as an excellent supplamentary for his lectures.

8) Interest and relevance of exercises
Noam: 

9) Level of exercises

16) Would you attend other Talent courses and would you recommend colleagues and fellow students to attend?
